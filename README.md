This is only a HARDWARE fork ! The existing firmware/bootloadr/documantation will work on this board.

The original data is preserved in the REV4 folder

## Changes

- Converted project to Altium Designer
- Changed the FTDI chip from a QFN package to SSO20 for easier soldering.
- Clean up schematic.
- Clean up all footprints and load 3D models
- Change board outline.
- Redone all routing.
- Change to 4 layer board.
- Designed the board to fit a small off-the-shelf Hammond enclosure.
- Endcap available as a PCB so you don;t have to drill the plastic endcap of the box.

## Layout

The Board is a 4 layer PCB that can easily be produced by the likes of JLCPCB or PCBway.  A full production pack (Gerber / NCdrill, BOM , Pick and place ) is available. 

## Assembly

The Bom and pick and place is included for assembly.

## Source Files

All source files are available in Altium Format. That's what i know, have and use. Other CAD programs most likely can import those. So you can modify.
