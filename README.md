This is only a HARDWARE fork ! The existing firmware/bootloadr/documantation will work on this board.

The original data is preserved in the REV4 folder

Changes
=======

- Converted project to Altium Designer *
- Changed the FTDI chip from a QFN package to SSO20 for easier soldering
- Clean up schematic
- Clean up all footprints and load 3D models
- Change board outline
- Redone all routing
- Change to 4 layer board
- Shield ring added



Why Altium Designer
===================
The original project was made in KiCAD. This is a tool i do not know. I have been using Altium in one form or antoher since it came on a 720K floppy disk in 1986.
I'm simply way more proficient and productive using tools i know and have been using for decades. 
I Have provided all source files. Most PCB CAD tools can read Altium Files (KiCAD can), or thesre is an intermediate way through another tool.

You have the source, there are (free) tools that can read it and manipulate it.
Anything else is a discussion I do not want to engage in or spend effort on.
